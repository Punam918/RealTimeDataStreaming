# Realtime Data Streaming Project

## Introduction 
This project employs a multifaceted technological stack to establish an end-to-end data processing pipeline. The workflow commences by fetching data from the `randomuser.me` API to generate synthetic user data. This raw data is subsequently channeled through **Apache Airflow** for data orchestration and storage in a **PostgreSQL** database. 

The data is then streamed through **Apache Kafka** in conjunction with **Apache Zookeeper** to facilitate real-time data movement from PostgreSQL to the processing engine. For streamlined management and monitoring of Kafka streams, **Control Center** and **Schema Registry** are employed to handle schema configurations and ensure effective oversight of the data streams.

Subsequently, **Apache Spark** is utilized to conduct data processing tasks, following which the processed data is persisted in a **Cassandra** database, providing a durable storage solution for the refined information.

The entire pipeline is encapsulated within **Docker** containers, affording a streamlined and portable deployment mechanism.

## Technologies
- **Data Source**:  `randomuser.me` API is used to generate random user data for the pipeline.
- **Apache Airflow**: Helps with orchestrating the pipeline and storing fetched data in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Apache Kafka and Zookeeper**: Used for streaming data from PostgreSQL to the processing engine.
- **Control Center and Schema Registry**: Helps in monitoring and schema management of the Kafka streams.
- **Apache Spark**: Responsible for data processing with master and worker nodes.
- **Cassandra**: Database to store the processed data.
- **Docker**: Containerize the entire pipeline.

## This project includes
- Establishing a data pipeline using Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration and data management.
- Implementing real-time data streaming through Apache Kafka to facilitate data transfer and processing in real-time.
- Enabling distributed synchronization using Apache Zookeeper for robust coordination and reliability in a distributed system.
- Employing data processing techniques powered by Apache Spark for efficient and scalable data transformation and analysis.
- Utilizing data storage solutions with PostgreSQL and Cassandra to securely store and manage structured and unstructured data, respectively.
- Containerizing the entire data engineering infrastructure with Docker to ensure portability and ease of deployment across various environments.
